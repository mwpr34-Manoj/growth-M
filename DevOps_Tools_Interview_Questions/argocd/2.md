🔥 Top 10 ArgoCD Interview Questions You Must Know (2025 Edition) 🔥
Whether you are preparing for a DevOps Engineer, SRE, or Platform Engineer role these 10 questions you must know.

🧠 1️⃣ What is ArgoCD and how does it fit into the GitOps model?
👉 Expected: Understanding that ArgoCD continuously syncs the Kubernetes cluster state with Git as the source of truth.

⚙️ 2️⃣ How does ArgoCD differ from traditional CI/CD tools like Jenkins or Tekton?
👉 Expected: CI tools build & test; ArgoCD focuses on continuous deployment via GitOps principles.

🔁 3️⃣ How does ArgoCD detect and reconcile configuration drift?
👉 Expected: ArgoCD monitors live vs. desired state using Git commits, and can auto-sync or alert.

🧩 4️⃣ Explain ArgoCD architecture components.
👉 Expected: API Server, Application Controller, Repo Server, Redis, and UI — and how they interact.

🌐 5️⃣ How do you manage multi-cluster or multi-environment setups in ArgoCD?
👉 Expected: Use one control plane managing multiple clusters via secrets or ArgoCD ApplicationSets.

🛡️ 6️⃣ How do you secure ArgoCD in a production setup?
👉 Expected: RBAC, SSO (OIDC), repository access control, HTTPS, and network policies.

🧱 7️⃣ What are ArgoCD Applications and Projects?
👉 Expected:
Applications = Git-tracked K8s manifests to deploy.
Projects = logical grouping of apps with RBAC & policy boundaries.
🚨 8️⃣ How do you perform rollback in ArgoCD?
👉 Expected: ArgoCD tracks app history via Git commits — you can rollback to any previous version in one click or CLI command.

🧭 9️⃣ What are ArgoCD sync policies (manual vs. auto-sync)?
👉 Expected:
Manual Sync: user-triggered
Auto Sync: continuous reconciliation with Git state

🧰 🔟 How do you integrate ArgoCD with Helm, Kustomize, or plain manifests?
👉 Expected: ArgoCD natively supports all three — you can deploy Helm charts, Kustomize overlays, or raw YAML directly from Git.

💡 Pro Tip:
If you can confidently explain how Git becomes your source of truth and how ArgoCD reconciles drift automatically, you’re already ahead of 80% of DevOps candidates.
